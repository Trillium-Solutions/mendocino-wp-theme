##Theme Features

The MTA theme uses categories to differentiate post types. Posts can be created in the wp-admin area and the appropriate category can be selected from Alerts, News, and Board Information. 

The majority of content for route pages must be edited from the theme code. The route descriptions, connections, and timetables can all be edited from the wp-admin area. 

####Service Alerts

In addition to selecting the *Alerts* category, service alerts must be tagged with the applicable zone(s) affected by the alert. 'Most Used Tags' can be used to find possible categories. 

####Menus

Most menus are hard-coded into the site to ensure consistent design, however the rightmost footer menu can be edited from the wp-admin area.
